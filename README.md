Islami App
Islami App is a mobile application designed to provide a platform for various Islamic resources and features. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, utilizes Retrofit for network requests, incorporates MediaPlayer for audio playback, includes a SplashScreen, and offers a navigation system for seamless user experience.

Features
Quraan: Access the Holy Quran with translations and audio recitations.
Tasbeeh: Use a digital Tasbeeh for easy and accurate counting of your dhikr.
Radio: Listen to Islamic radio stations and broadcasts.
Splash Screen: A visually appealing splash screen greets users when they launch the app.
Navigation: A user-friendly navigation menu allows easy access to different sections of the app.
Technologies Used
MVC Architecture: The app is organized using the Model-View-Controller architecture, which separates data handling, user interface, and control logic for better maintainability.

Retrofit: We use Retrofit for making HTTP requests to fetch data from remote servers. It simplifies network calls and handles data parsing.
